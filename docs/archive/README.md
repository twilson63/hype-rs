# Development Archive

This directory contains completed phase documentation from the hype-rs project development cycle. These documents provide historical context, detailed implementation notes, and completion reports for each phase.

## Phase 3: Module Loader & Built-in Modules

Learn how the module system was architected and implemented with support for built-in modules.

- **[PHASE_3_EXECUTION_PLAN.md](./PHASE_3_EXECUTION_PLAN.md)** - Detailed execution plan and task breakdown
- **[PHASE_3_COMPLETION.md](./PHASE_3_COMPLETION.md)** - Completion report with deliverables and test results

**Summary**: 1,167 LOC delivered across module registry, loader, resolver, and 5 built-in modules (fs, path, events, util, table). 56 tests covering all functionality.

## Phase 4: Lua Integration

Discover how the module system was integrated with Lua, including global require() function and module environment setup.

- **[PHASE_4_EXECUTION_PLAN.md](./PHASE_4_EXECUTION_PLAN.md)** - Detailed execution plan and integration strategy
- **[PHASE_4_COMPLETION.md](./PHASE_4_COMPLETION.md)** - Completion report with integration results

**Summary**: 1,200+ LOC delivered for Lua integration, CLI `--module` flag, and comprehensive module environment. 65+ tests ensuring seamless Lua-Rust module interaction. 2,750 LOC of documentation with 4 example applications.

## Phase 5: Testing & Validation

Explore advanced testing strategies, performance benchmarking, and edge case coverage.

- **[PHASE_5_EXECUTION_PLAN.md](./PHASE_5_EXECUTION_PLAN.md)** - Testing strategy and benchmark plan
- **[PHASE_5_COMPLETION.md](./PHASE_5_COMPLETION.md)** - Completion report with test coverage and performance data

**Summary**: 2,600+ LOC of tests covering advanced scenarios, stress testing, and performance validation. 80+ new tests achieving 97%+ code coverage. 11 benchmarks with all targets exceeded by 100x+. 2 additional documentation files (testing.md, performance.md) and 3 example applications.

## Using These Documents

These documents are valuable for:
- **Understanding implementation decisions** - Each phase plan includes rationale and design decisions
- **Reviewing test coverage** - Completion reports detail all tests and their purpose
- **Learning from the development process** - Detailed execution plans show how complex features were broken down
- **Historical context** - Documents preserve the evolution of the project
