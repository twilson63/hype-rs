# Project Request Protocol (PRP): Hype-RS Lua Runtime

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Hype-RS  
**Project Type:** Command-line Lua Runtime Implementation  
**Primary Goal:** Create a Rust-based command-line application that can execute Lua scripts from files  
**Target Users:** Developers needing a lightweight, fast Lua runtime for scripting and automation  

The project aims to build a Lua interpreter/runtime written in Rust that can execute Lua files via the command line. This is the foundation for a larger Lua runtime ecosystem, starting with basic script execution capabilities.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functional Requirements
1. **Command-line Interface**: Accept Lua file paths as command-line arguments
2. **Lua Script Execution**: Parse and execute Lua scripts from files
3. **Output Handling**: Capture and display script output (stdout/stderr)
4. **Error Handling**: Provide meaningful error messages for syntax errors and runtime exceptions
5. **File I/O**: Read Lua source code from files on the filesystem

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Fast startup time and execution speed
2. **Memory Safety**: Leverage Rust's memory safety guarantees
3. **Cross-platform**: Support Windows, macOS, and Linux
4. **Extensibility**: Architecture should support future enhancements (debugging, modules, etc.)
5. **Standards Compliance**: Support Lua 5.1+ syntax and semantics

### Technical Constraints
- Must be written in Rust
- Should minimize external dependencies where possible
- Binary size should be reasonable for distribution
- Must handle common Lua constructs (variables, functions, control flow, etc.)

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Use `rlua` Crate (High-level Lua Bindings)

**Description**: Utilize the `rlua` crate, which provides high-level Rust bindings to the Lua C API.

**Architecture**:
- Main binary parses command-line arguments
- Uses `rlua::Lua` to create Lua state
- Loads and executes Lua files via `rlua` API
- Handles errors and output through Rust abstractions

**Pros**:
- Mature, well-maintained crate with good documentation
- High-level API reduces boilerplate and complexity
- Built-in safety features and Rust idioms
- Good performance characteristics
- Active community support

**Cons**:
- External dependency on Lua C library
- Less control over low-level implementation details
- Potential licensing considerations (Lua is MIT)
- May have limitations for deep customization

### Solution 2: Use `mlua` Crate (Modern Lua Bindings)

**Description**: Implement using `mlua`, a modern Lua binding for Rust that supports multiple Lua versions.

**Architecture**:
- CLI argument parsing using `clap`
- Lua state management via `mlua::Lua`
- Async support capabilities for future extensions
- Modular design for different Lua versions

**Pros**:
- Supports multiple Lua versions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, LuaJIT)
- Async/await support built-in
- Excellent performance and memory safety
- Active development and maintenance
- Flexible feature flags for dependency management

**Cons**:
- More complex API due to version support
- Larger dependency tree
- Learning curve for advanced features
- Potential binary size increase

### Solution 3: Custom Lua Interpreter Implementation

**Description**: Build a custom Lua interpreter from scratch using Rust parsing and execution engines.

**Architecture**:
- Custom lexer and parser using `nom` or similar parsing library
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation
- Bytecode compiler and virtual machine
- Standard library implementation

**Pros**:
- Complete control over implementation
- No external Lua dependencies
- Maximum customization potential
- Educational value and deep understanding
- Potential for unique optimizations

**Cons**:
- Extremely high implementation complexity
- Long development timeline
- Risk of compatibility issues
- Maintenance burden
- Reinventing well-solved problems

## Recommended Solution: Solution 2 (`mlua` Crate)

**Rationale**: The `mlua` crate provides the best balance of performance, flexibility, and development speed for this project. It offers:

1. **Future-proofing**: Support for multiple Lua versions allows easy upgrades
2. **Performance**: Excellent execution speed and memory efficiency
3. **Extensibility**: Async support and modular design enable future features
4. **Development Velocity**: High-level API accelerates initial implementation
5. **Community**: Active maintenance and good documentation

### Phase 4: Testing and Optimization
1. Write comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. Performance benchmarking against standard Lua
3. Memory usage optimization
4. Cross-platform testing and validation
5. Documentation and examples

### Phase 5: Distribution and Packaging
1. Create release builds for multiple platforms
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline
3. Create installation scripts and documentation
4. Package for common package managers (cargo, brew, etc.)
